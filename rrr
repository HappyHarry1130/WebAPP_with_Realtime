### Steps to Solve:

1. **Volume of the Original Prism**: The volume of the original prism is \(V = a \times b \times c\).

2. **Volume of the Smaller Prism**: After the cut, the smaller prism has a volume of 288 cubic units.

3. **Possible Rotations**: Consider the possible rotations and cuts:
   - If rotated around \(a\), the dimensions become \(a, c, b\).
   - If rotated around \(b\), the dimensions become \(b, c, a\).
   - If rotated around \(c\), the dimensions become \(c, b, a\).

4. **Determine the Cut**: The cut is parallel to the base of the original prism, which means the base dimensions remain the same. The height of the smaller prism is reduced.

5. **Equation Setup**: The volume of the smaller prism is given by the product of the base area and the new height. We need to find integer values of \(a, b, c\) such that one of these configurations results in a smaller prism with a volume of 288.

### Solving for \(b\):

Let's assume the cut is made parallel to the base with dimensions \(a \times b\), and the height is reduced from \(c\) to some integer \(h\). Then:

\[ a \times b \times h = 288 \]

Since \(a < b < c\), we need to find integer values for \(a, b, c\) that satisfy this equation and the conditions.

### Trial and Error:

1. **Factorization of 288**: The prime factorization of 288 is \(2^5 \times 3^2\). We need to distribute these factors among \(a, b, h\).

2. **Possible Values**:
   - Try \(a = 4\), \(b = 6\), \(h = 12\) (since \(4 \times 6 \times 12 = 288\)).
   - Check if \(a < b < c\) holds for these values.

3. **Verification**:
   - If \(a = 4\), \(b = 6\), and \(c = 12\), then \(a < b < c\) is satisfied.
   - The original volume \(V = 4 \times 6 \times 12 = 288\).

Thus, the value of \(b\) is \(6\).
